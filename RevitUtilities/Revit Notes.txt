    """Family Class - This object gets the family symbols that belong to the family so that instances can be swapped from one symbol to another. 
    Families within the Revit API represented by three objects - Family, FamilySymbol and FamilyInstance. 
    Each object plays a significant part in the structure of Families. 
    The Family object represents the entire family such as an 'I Beam'. 
    You can think of that object as representing the entire family file on disk. 
    The Family object contains a number of FamilySymbols. 
    The FamilySymbol object represents a specific set of family settings within that Family 
    and represents what is known in the Revit user interface as a Type, such as 'W14x32'. 
    The FamilyInstance object represents an actual instance of that Type (FamilySymbol) within the Autodesk Revit project. 
    For example the FamilyInstance would be a single instance of a W14x32 column within the project. 
    Therefore: Each FamilyInstance has one FamilySymbol, e.g. an instance of a W14x32. Each FamilySymbol belongs to one Family,
    e.g. the W14x32 symbol belongs to an 'I Beam' family. Each Family will contain one or more FamilySymbols, 
    e.g. the 'I Beam' family contains a W14x32 symbol, a W12x32 symbol etc.    """
