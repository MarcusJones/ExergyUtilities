To use cProfile to capture your application's profile data, either using the command-line, like so:

$ python -m cProfile -o <outputfilename> <script-name> <options>

Or in code, like so:

import cProfile
command = """reactor.run()"""
cProfile.runctx( command, globals(), locals(), filename="OpenGLContext.profile" )

To view the results of your run:

python runsnake.py OpenGLContext.profile

There will be a brief delay as the application is created and begins the loading process, then you should see something like this:
